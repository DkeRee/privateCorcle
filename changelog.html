          <li>Levels Five and Six were found to be too hard, nerfed them as much as I thought would be possible without breaking the game. Please, join the discord by clicking the Discord icon and give me feedback so I can improve this game. I tend to make levels too hard. I will listen to all your suggestions and try to implement them as efficiently as possible.</li>
